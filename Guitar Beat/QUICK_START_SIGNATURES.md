# Quick Start: Rhythmic Signatures

## How to Use

1. **Open Signature Picker**
   - Tap the signature button (e.g., "🎵 4 / 4 ▼") below the sound name

2. **Choose Your Signature**
   - Scroll the left wheel to set numerator (1-16)
   - Scroll the right wheel to set denominator (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
   - OR tap a preset button (4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 5/4)

3. **Tap Apply**
   - Metronome restarts with new signature
   - First beat of each measure is accented

## Common Signatures Quick Reference

| Signature | Name | Feel | Common Usage |
|-----------|------|------|--------------|
| **4/4** | Common time | STRONG-weak-medium-weak | Rock, pop, most music |
| **3/4** | Waltz time | STRONG-weak-weak | Waltz, minuet |
| **2/4** | March time | STRONG-weak | Marches, polkas |
| **6/8** | Compound duple | STRONG-weak-weak-medium-weak-weak | Ballads, jigs |
| **5/4** | Quintuple | STRONG-weak-weak-weak-weak | Take Five, prog rock |
| **7/8** | Septuple | Various groupings | Balkan music, prog |

## Practice Examples

### Speed Building (Example: 100 BPM)
```
Step 1: 100 BPM, 4/4  → Quarter notes (normal)
Step 2: 100 BPM, 4/8  → Eighth notes (2x faster clicks)
Step 3: 100 BPM, 4/16 → Sixteenth notes (4x faster clicks)
```

### Odd Meter Practice
```
Set 7/8 or 5/4
Listen for the accent on beat 1
Count along: 1-2-3-4-5-1-2-3-4-5...
Practice riffs that fit the pattern
```

### Subdivision Practice
```
Play your scale/riff
Start: 1/4 (quarter notes) - comfortable
Next: 1/8 (eighth notes) - faster
Next: 1/16 (sixteenth notes) - very fast
Goal: Stay steady at each level
```

## Tips

- **Listen for the accent**: It marks beat 1 in each measure
- **Count out loud**: Helps internalize the pattern
- **Start slow**: Master the pattern before increasing BPM
- **Use presets**: Quick access to common signatures
- **Combine with BPM changes**: Gradually increase speed while maintaining pattern

## Timing Formula

The app calculates click intervals as:
```
interval = (60 / BPM) × (4 / denominator)
```

**Quick math at 120 BPM:**
- 4/4 → 500ms (normal)
- 4/8 → 250ms (2x faster)
- 4/16 → 125ms (4x faster)
- 4/2 → 1000ms (2x slower)
